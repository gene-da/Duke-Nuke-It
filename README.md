Duke-Nuke-It

A glorified digital incinerator.
Drop a directory path into this thing and it will happily corrupt, overwrite, delete, and erase the entire folder from existence.

No recycling bin. No “oops.” No take-backs.

Use responsibly… or at least creatively.

# How to Use

```bash
python nuke_it.py <insert directory path>
```

# Example

```bash
python nuke_it.py "C:\Users\user\Desktop\All Things\Duke Nukem"
```
